<p>Welcome to the SilverStripe CMS link checker section.</p>

<p>To check for broken links on your site now, choose "Start link checker" on the left hand panel.</p>

<p>Checking all pages on your site for broken links may take a long time.  The more pages with links you have, the longer it will take.</p>

<p>Once all pages have been checked, a report will appear with broken links found, with a link to the page to fix it.  That
	report can be found on the left hand panel, the latest link check run will appear at the top of the list.</p>
